# Magic Square is a array of numbers where rows,columns and diagonal are all equal to same value.__

# For example in the matrix below__
#  * 8 * 1 * 6 * __
#  * 3 * 5 * 7 * __
#  * 4 * 9 * 2 *
# The sum of rows,columns and matrix are equal to 15. __
# We can write this in two ways (atleast i can think of) one is using foreach and the other one is using sum constraint. __
